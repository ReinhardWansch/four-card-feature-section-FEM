## What I learned

The following workflow has proven to be efficient and is suitable for learning:
- Show design images to an AI and have them analyzed
- Basic setup of the repo with the libraries and frameworks that you want to use and learn
- Have the entire code generated
- Have the parts that you don't understand explained and play around with them in another repo
- Make final adjustments and "submit"
